    "# Random Forest Classifier For Spam Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the usage of the random forest classifier model for the purpose of classifying spam emails. I chose the rfc model for the following reasons: it is highly robust due to the number of decision trees, it does not suffer from overfitting as a result of the averages which removes bias, it can handle missing values using either median values or proximity-weighted averages, and the relative feature importance is easily accessible. However, the random forests method is slower than others because of the necessity of creating multiple decision trees. For each prediction, each tree will have to make a prediction and then the model will need to vote. Moreover, the model can be more difficult to interpret as compared to a regular decision tree since it cannot be followed along a singular path. Despite the issues of the random forests model, the benefits seem to outweigh the problems and so it is likely the best option."
